{"name":"Code","body":"### Uber leet code\r\nToo be like all the cool kids, I needed to put something up here. So here are some really simple tools I have randomly written.\r\n\r\n### apy \r\napy is a simple replacemet for stuff I use awk for.  Basically I just wanted to type less.\r\n\r\nSo you can:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"zero:one:two:three\" | apy -F: -N, 3 2 1 0\r\nthree,two,one,zero\r\n```\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"one:two:three:four\" | awk -F: '{print $4\",\"$3\",\"$2\",\"$1\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use slices (think python lists).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"zero:one:two:three\" | apy -F: 1:\r\none two three\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly if you leave off the offsets to use apy will list them for you.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"zero:one:two:three\" | apy -F:\r\n[0]zero [1]one [2]two [3]three\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
